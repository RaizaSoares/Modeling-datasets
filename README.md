Study to find the highest test accuracy for a given dataset using five different classifiers
This study was conducted using five classifier models (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, K
Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Logistic regression) to classify heart disease data. I
picked these classifiers since they are often used for different kinds of data.
(example, Logistic regression is suitable for mostly linear solutions, while trees
and KNN do better with nonlinear solutions). The intention of performing this
study was to find out which classifier would work the best for our dataset. Three
valuation methods were tested because it is helpful to understand hoe these work
and how they affect the accuracy of our classifiers. This report goes through the
steps of preprocessing and in each section, there is an explanation of why it is vital
to perform that step.
